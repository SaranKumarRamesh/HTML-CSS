<h1>Optical Drives</h1>

<p>Optical drives include CD drives and DVD drives.</p>

<p>In Windows, 
drives are denoted by letters followed by colons. Hard drives start at C: and 
use subsequent letters (if needed). Optical drives typically use the next 
available letter, so common letters used for optical drives include D: or E:, 
depending on the setup of the specific system.</p>
