<h1>Hard Drives</h1>

<p>Hard drives (also called local drives) are used for long-term storage of
programs and data. In Windows, 
drives are denoted by letters followed by colons. The first hard drive is 
denoted by the letter C:. If there are any further hard drives (or logical 
partitions of the same physical drive), they would be denoted by the letters
D:, E:, and so on.</p>
